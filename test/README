    # Temperature Control for Heating Pump
This is a temperature control system for a heating pump, which turns the pump on when the temperature is below a certain value and off when it is above another value, with a hysteresis to avoid frequent toggling. The system can also be put into manual mode where the pump is always on. The system is optimized for low power consumption and uses the LowPower library to put the device to sleep when the pump is off and there is no user input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- OneWire library
- DallasTemperature library
- LowPower library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files as a zip file and extract them.
2. Open the `TemperaturSteuerung_HeizungsPumpe_Seminarraum_2023_v2.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the required libraries by going to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries` and searching for them by name.
4. Select the appropriate board and port under the `Tools` menu.
5. Compile and upload the sketch to the board.

### Usage

Connect a DallasTemperature sensor to pin 6 of the Arduino and a switch for manual mode to pin 3. Connect a relay switch to pin 9 to control the heating pump.

When the system is running in automatic mode, it will turn the pump on when the temperature is below the minimum temperature set in the code with a hysteresis value added, and turn it off when the temperature is above the maximum temperature set in the code with a hysteresis value added.

When the system is running in manual mode, the pump will always be on.

The system is designed to be power efficient by using the LowPower library to put the device to sleep when the pump is off and there is no user input.

BING KI VERSION:
This code controls a heating pump based on temperature readings from a DallasTemperature sensor. The pump is turned on when the temperature is below TEMP_MIN_C and turned off when it is above TEMP_MAX_C. A hysteresis of TEMP_HYSTERESIS_C is used to avoid frequent toggling of the pump. The code also supports a manual mode where the pump is always on. The code is optimized for low power consumption by using the LowPower library to put the device to sleep when the pump is off and there is no user input.

Here's a brief explanation of the important parts of the code:

The constants TEMP_MIN_C, TEMP_MAX_C, and TEMP_HYSTERESIS_C define the temperature range at which the pump should turn on and off, and the hysteresis to avoid frequent toggling of the pump.
The function handleRelayState() checks the current temperature reading and sets the relay state based on whether the temperature is below TEMP_MIN_C, above TEMP_MAX_C, or within the hysteresis range. If the relay state is changed, it also sets a delay to protect the pump before toggling the relay.
The function toggleRelay() toggles the relay pin based on the current relay state. If the state was changed, it also sets a delay to protect the pump.
The function goToSleep() puts the device into sleep mode using the LowPower library for a specified duration, which is defined by the constant SLEEP_DURATION_S.
The code also includes functions to read the temperature from the DallasTemperature sensor, check the state of the manual mode switch, and wait for a short time. Overall, the code is well-organized and easy to read, with clear comments to explain each section.
