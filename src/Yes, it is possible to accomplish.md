Yes, it is possible to accomplish with a three-wire connection. You can connect the switch and the LED in series with a resistor, and then connect the three wires to the Arduino as follows:

Connect one wire to the positive (+) side of the LED/resistor circuit.
Connect the second wire to one of the switch terminals.
Connect the third wire to the other switch terminal.
When the switch is closed, the LED will turn on and the positive side of the circuit will be connected to the Arduino pin. When the switch is open, the LED will turn off and the circuit will be disconnected from the Arduino pin.

Note that you will need to use a digital input pin on the Arduino to read the state of the switch. You can use the digitalRead() function in your code to read the state of the pin and toggle the manual mode accordingly.

explain the last suggestion with three wires more detailed
Sure, here's a more detailed explanation:

Instead of using a separate wire for the LED, you can use the same wire that goes to the switch to also control the LED. This is possible because the LED will only be on when the switch is on, so you don't need to be able to control it independently.

Yes, it is possible to accomplish with aTo do this, you would need to connect the anode (positive leg) of the LED to one of the pins on the switch, and connect the cathode (negative leg) of the LED to ground using a resistor. Then, you would connect the other pin on the switch to a digital input pin on the Arduino.

Here's an example diagram:

      Switch

      [GND]
In this diagram, the LED anode is connected to pin D2 on the Arduino, and the LED cathode is connected to ground through a 220 ohm resistor. The switch is connected between ground and pin D2. When the switch is open (off), pin D2 is connected to ground through the resistor, which limits the current through the LED and keeps it off. When the switch is closed (on), pin D2 is connected directly to the LED anode, which allows current to flow through the LED and light it up.

By reading the state of pin D2 in your code, you can determine whether the switch is on or off, and use that to toggle manual mode.




VigilanteSystems
same example you just generated just use pin3 for D2
Sure, here's an example using pin 3 (D2) on the Arduino Uno board:

Connect the anode (positive leg) of the LED to a current limiting resistor (e.g. 220 ohms) and connect the other end of the resistor to pin 3 (D2) of the Arduino.
Connect the cathode (negative leg) of the LED to ground (GND) of the Arduino.
Connect one end of the switch to pin 3 (D2) of the Arduino.
Connect the other end of the switch to ground (GND) of the Arduino.
When the switch is open, pin 3 (D2) is pulled up to Vcc through an internal pull-up resistor. When the switch is closed, pin 3 (D2) is shorted to ground, effectively creating a path for current to flow from pin 3 (D2) through the LED and the current limiting resistor to ground. This will turn on the LED.

Here's a schematic diagram of the circuit:

          This schematic represents a basic circuit that includes an LED, a resistor, and a switch. When the switch is closed, it allows current to flow from the 5V source through the resistor and the LED, lighting up the LED.

Pin 3 (D2) of the Arduino is connected to one side of the switch. When the switch is closed, it provides a connection between the D2 pin and ground, which is interpreted as a digital input by the Arduino. When D2 is set to input mode and pulled high, the switch is normally open and the Arduino reads a HIGH value. When the switch is closed, the connection is made to ground and the Arduino reads a LOW value.

The 220 ohm resistor limits the current flowing through the LED, protecting it from damage.


from this schematic, i have long wires to connect to this schematic which is build together as one module, this connects with three wires to a arduino thats further away
Yes, based on the schematic you provided, it looks like you have three wires that connect to the module: one wire to the 5V pin, one wire to pin 3 (D2), and one wire to GND. These wires can be extended to connect to an Arduino that is located further away. Just make sure that the wires are long enough to reach the Arduino, and that they are connected to the correct pins on the Arduino.

Yes, that is correct. The three wires can be extended to reach the Arduino that is located further away. The wire connected to the 5V pin on the module should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino, the wire connected to pin 3 (D2) should be connected to a digital input pin on the Arduino, and the wire connected to GND should be connected to the GND pin on the Arduino. Make sure to double check the pin connections to ensure proper functionality.

Yes, that's correct. When you close the switch, it will connect the wire going to pin 3 (D2) to 5V. This will cause a logic high signal to be detected by the Arduino on pin 3, which can be read as a digital input. At the same time, the LED will light up because it is connected in series with the switch and resistor to 5V, which will allow current to flow through it.

When the switch is open, the wire going to pin 3 (D2) is not connected to 5V, so the logic signal on pin 3 will be low. In this case, the LED will not light up because there is no current flowing through it.

So in summary, when the switch is closed, the LED lights up and the Arduino detects a logic high signal on pin 3 (D2), and when the switch is open, the LED is off and the Arduino detects a logic low signal on pin 3 (D2).

in this example which of the three wires go to which arduino pin/output? pin3 D2 seems clear, where do the other connect?
In the example schematic I provided, the wire connected to the positive side of the LED (the side connected to the resistor) should be connected to the +5V pin on the Arduino. The wire connected to the cathode of the LED (the side connected to ground) should be connected to the GND pin on the Arduino. So to summarize:

Wire connected to the resistor: +5V pin on the Arduino
Wire connected to the cathode of the LED: GND pin on the Arduino
Wire connected to the switch: Pin 3 (D2) on the Arduino

        LED/Switch/Resistor Module
In this schematic, wire1 connects to the +5V rail, wire2 connects to Pin 3 (D2) on the Arduino module, and wire3 connects to the GND rail.

Yes, that's correct. When you close the switch, it will connect the wire going to pin 3 (D2) to 5V. This will cause a logic high signal to be detected by the Arduino on pin 3, which can be read as a digital input. At the same time, the LED will light up because it is connected in series with the switch and resistor to 5V, which will allow current to flow through it.

When the switch is open, the wire going to pin 3 (D2) is not connected to 5V, so the logic signal on pin 3 will be low. In this case, the LED will not light up because there is no current flowing through it.

So in summary, when the switch is closed, the LED lights up and the Arduino detects a logic high signal on pin 3 (D2), and when the switch is open, the LED is off and the Arduino detects a logic low signal on pin 3 (D2).

One possible optimization you could make is to add a current-limiting resistor in series with the LED. In your current schematic, you have a 220 ohm resistor connected in series with the LED, but it's not clear if this resistor is serving as a current limiter or if it's being used to protect the LED from overvoltage.

Assuming that you want to limit the current through the LED, you should choose a resistor value that is appropriate for your specific LED. The LED datasheet should provide information on the maximum forward current and forward voltage drop. From there, you can calculate the appropriate resistor value using Ohm's law.

Another possible optimization is to add a pull-down resistor between pin 3 (D2) and GND. This will ensure that the input pin is pulled low when the switch is not pressed, which can help prevent false readings or electrical noise from triggering the input.

Finally, if you're planning to use this circuit for a larger project, you may want to consider using a breadboard or a custom PCB to make the connections more reliable and reduce the risk of loose connections.
